# 🎵 Apple Music XML to YouTube MP3 Downloader

This Python project helps you **automatically find and download your favorite songs**  
from **Apple Music's XML library** by **searching on YouTube** and saving them as **MP3 files** locally.

✅ **Selects only your favorite tracks** based on a **minimum Play Count**.  
✅ **Searches and downloads automatically** — no manual song-by-song work!  
✅ **Simple** command-line interface with **rich colorful prompts**.

---

## 📂 How It Works

1. **Apple Music** exports a `.xml` file containing all your library metadata (songs, artists, albums, etc).
2. This script **parses** that XML and **filters** the songs by your defined favorite criteria (like "Play Count > 5").
3. For each favorite song, it **searches YouTube** using the song name and artist.
4. Downloads the **best audio**, **converts it to MP3**, and saves it to your desired folder.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Packages:
  - [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (to download from YouTube)
  - [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) (for nice prompts and output)

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp rich
```

Additionally, you must have **ffmpeg** installed for MP3 conversion:  
(On Mac/Linux: `brew install ffmpeg` or `sudo apt install ffmpeg`, Windows: download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/)).

---

## 📥 How to Use

1. **Export your Apple Music library XML file**:
   - Open Apple Music > File > Library > Export Library.
   - Save as something like `MusicLibrary.xml`.

2. **Run the script**:

```bash
python downloader.py
```

3. **Answer the prompts**:
   - **Path to XML** — location of your exported `.xml` file.
   - **Download destination** — folder where MP3 files will be saved.
   - **Minimum Play Count** — threshold to consider a song "favorite" (e.g., 5 times played).

4. **Sit back and relax!**  
The script will find your favorite songs, search for them on YouTube, download, and save them as MP3s.

## 📄 Example

Sample session:

```
Enter the path to your Apple Music XML file: /Users/hemang/MusicLibrary.xml
Enter the path where you want to save MP3 files: /Users/hemang/Downloads/Favorites
Enter minimum Play Count to consider as favorite [default 5]: 8

Found 17 favorite songs. Starting download...

Searching and downloading: Dollar Sidhu Moose Wala
Searching and downloading: 21 Jimmie Allen
...

All downloads finished!
```

## 🎯 Features

- 🎯 **Only favorite songs**: Avoid clutter. Only download songs you actually love!
- 🔎 **Automatic YouTube search**: No need to manually find links.
- 🎵 **MP3 format**: Ready to listen or upload anywhere.
- 📈 **Customizable Play Count threshold**: Choose how "favorite" you want your selection to be.
- 🚀 **Fast and lightweight**.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Options (Inside the Script)

You can manually change inside `download_song_from_youtube()` if needed:
- MP3 bitrate (default is 192kbps)
- Audio format (can be `mp3`, `aac`, `m4a`, etc)
- Download more than 1 result (`ytsearch5` instead of `ytsearch1`) — currently it picks the **top YouTube result**.

---

## 📌 Notes

- The search is **based on song name and artist** — sometimes results may vary slightly depending on YouTube availability.
- If a song has special characters in the name, `yt-dlp` will handle it automatically.
- Apple Music "Loved" tag is not supported yet because the XML sample doesn't include it (future enhancement!).

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Detect "Loved" songs (if possible).
- Show a download **progress bar** for each song.
- Auto-organize songs into folders (Artist/Album).
